Smart Contract and Wallet Monitoring 

The world of blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi) 
is rapidly growing also hacking and rug-pulling have increased massively, 
with people losing their fortune. The blockchain is open to anyone 
to keep track of what is going on in their favourite dApp smart contract 
or wallet; That’s where Tenderly Alert comes in — It makes you listen to 
an on-chain event and receive notification via supported destination.

## Prerequisite
A Tenderly account.
Add Dai stable coin (DAI) to smart contract on Tenderly Dashboard.

## What is Tenderly Alert?
Tenderly Alert is a monitoring tool for smart contracts and wallets that allow you to listen for on-chain events and receive notifications in different destinations such as email, Slack, webhooks, Sentry, PagerDuty etc.

## What Type of On-chain Event Can I Listen to?

by default the Active Destinations is Primary Email which is email used 
to register on Tenderly.

## Let Monitor DAI Smart Contract
DAI is a stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain whose value is kept as close to one United States dollar. I have already added the DAI Smart contract address to my list of contracts. Let’s set up our first alert to monitor any Transfer done on DAI that is above 1000.

1. click on Alerts by the left menu bar under Monitoring.

2. In the Rules tab click on Setup an Alert button

3. In Alert Type Select Event Parameter

5. Under Parameters: Parameters are broken down into:

|Select Argument| Each method comes with/without an argument, we will wad|
|Select Comparison| There is various comparison benchmark you can use such as Equal to, Not Equal to, Greater than etc|
|Comparison Value| This is the value you want to set as a benchmark.This is saying Notify me for every transfer of DAI greater than 1000|

6. Destination: we will be using email, 
which can be set by switching it on. click on save when done.

7. Congratulations: once save you will be redirected to the newly created 
alert with all the information about the alert, with options to Duplicate 
the Alert, Edit or Remove.
