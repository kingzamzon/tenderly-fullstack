# Tenderly Sandbox

Tenderly Sandbox is a code editor created as a friendlier environment for 
Web3 developers. It is a fast prototyping environment where you can write, 
execute, and debug smart contracts in the browser using Solidity and 
JavaScript.

The Tenderly Sandbox environment supports a side-by-side building of 
smart contracts and scripts. It supports Solidity and JavaScript. 
It has an underpinning infrastructure that compiles the Solidity codes. 
On the other hand, the browser handles the execution of the JavaScript 
codes. Once a contract or script is saved, the developer can generate a 
unique shareable link to it.

## Tenderly Sandbox Features
- Easily share code since sandbox comes with a unique URL.
- No Installation is Needed.
- It is free with no cost of setup.
- It runs a fork of the mainnet which allows you to write a smart contract 
that works with the mainnet smart contract.
- Use JavaScript to Interact with Smart contracts with either Ethers.js or 
Web3.js.
- It supports various EVM chains ranging from Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, 
Arbitrum, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Fantom, Gnosis Chain, etc.

## Tenderly Sandbox User Interface(UI)
The Sandbox User Interface is made up of four panels:

1. Solidity editor: write your Solidity smart contract code here.
2. JavaScript editor: write your JavaScript code that deploys the smart 
contracts and interacts with them.
3. JavaScript console output: this is where you can view the outcome of the 
JavaScript execution, as well as any errors that occurred during the process.
4. Simulate Transactions: a list of transactions that have occurred due 
to your Solidity and JavaScript code, as well as a convenient method for 
loading any transaction into the Debugger to examine the executing trace 
and additional information.

## Your First Smart Contract Using Tenderly Sandbox
Create an account on Tenderly to enjoy Sandbox full feature, if you donâ€™t 
have one. We will be creating a smart contract that allows us to store our 
favourite number, called FavouriteNumber.
1. Create New Sandbox: Visit https://sandbox.tenderly.co and click on the 
drop down near the logo sandbox. Select New Sandbox and enter a unique name 
for your sandbox and click Save.

2. Replace contract.sol and script.js: When you create a new Sandbox, 
the top two panels will be populated with a HelloWorld smart contract and 
JavaScript code example.

Replace the contract.sol

Replace script.js

3. Click Run to compile the smart contract and execute your JavaScript code. 
Optionally configure your Sandbox by selecting the network, block, 
compiler version, and setting compiler optimizations.

The Simulate Transactions panel will list all the transactions that 
resulted from your smart contract. Clicking on any transaction to load it 
into the Tenderly Dashboard to inspect the execution trace or perform 
other debugging tasks.
Congratulation ðŸ™Œ you just deployed your first smart contract using 
Tenderly Sandbox.
