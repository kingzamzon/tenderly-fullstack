# Transaction

Transaction is body and soul of any blockchain, everything that happen on 
the blockchain is a transaction, including invocation of function on 
a smart contract. 
We will be using Tenderly to keep track of what happen 
in a transaction presenting it in a human-readable form. 
Let’s dive into Tenderly transactions: create a Tenderly account first.

1. **Add smart contract Address:** To enjoy tenderly the smart contract has to be verified, 
you can verify your smart contract on tenderly or on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/). 
Without verification Tenderly shows random numbers instead of a 
human-readable form.
Navigate to **Transactions** and click **Add Contracts**
 button.

In this example, we will be using Dai stable coin (DAI). 
DAI is a stablecoin by [MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/en/) on the Ethereum blockchain which 
is pegged with the United State dollar(USD). 
Head over to [https://etherscan.io/tokens](https://etherscan.io/tokens) to find a token.

**Copy the contract address:** Locate the copy button close to the address.

**Paste contract address:** Navigate to Transactions where **Add contract modal** is opened. 
Paste the copied contract address, select the network as mainnet. 
When done click **Add Contract** button.

Automatically, 
Transactions tab now shows all transaction confirm on Dai stablecoin.

**1. Filter Transaction:** This gives the ability to filter transactions on 
the table based on success, failed, etc. 
This does not come with a free account though.

**2. Configure Columns:** Allows the ability to add or remove 
columns on the table, with a toggle switch.

Let’s analyse a single transaction, in this example, we will be using 
a failed transaction, 
kindly use the paginator at the bottom of the table to navigate.

### Analysing a single transaction

Click on the Transaction Hash(Tx Hash) to select a single transaction.

**1. Overview:** It shows a summary of what went down in the transaction including.

*Stack Trace:* This is the path the transaction took.

*Stack Trace Overview:* Everything that happens in the transaction till it gets to its failed state. You can search through the trace, and jump between; revert by clicking show revert. Functions can easily be annotated which
can help when debugging a problem and collaborating in a team.

**2. Contracts:** This shows all the contracts that are involved in the 
transaction. In this particular transaction UniswapV3Pool, OlympusERC20Token,
 Dai, Vault etc. contracts were involved.

**3. Events:** For a failed transaction there is no event, 
checking a successful transaction from the dashboard brings a beautiful 
view of all the events that were called by different smart contracts. 
Events in a single transaction can be filtered by contracts or event names.

**4. State Changes:** This shows all the state changes of all the contracts 
that participated in the execution of this transaction in human-readable 
form.

**5. Debugger:** Debugger allows movement through the call trace of the 
smart contracts involved in the transaction. Tenderly Debugger is a 
Jump by jump debugger, which allows the view of all the functions that 
were involved in the calls to external contracts or calls to function, 
with comment support to discuss hacks and likes.
Though not all contract sources are available for debugging.

**6. Gas Profiler:** This is like the flame graph in the CPU but for 
transactions. It shows how much gas your transaction consumes; 
including a deep analysis of the amount each function is consuming. 
This can help you in your decision on optimizing gas usage and saving 
the customer money.

**7. Re-Simulate:** This load up the transaction in the Simulator, 
which gives you access to re-run the same transaction, 
which you can use to debug what might have gone wrong.

**8. View on Explorer:** This opens up the transaction in Etherscan.

As you have seen above, Tenderly features are powerful for smart contract development; and each feature compliment the other,
- It produces blockchain data in human-readable form.
- It keeps track of the event life cycle of smart contracts.
- It provides private smart contract verification.
- It offers transaction simulation which has been used by Instadapp.
