# Tenderly Explorer

The rise of different blockchains has brought various explorers with it, 
that provide detailed analytics about its blockchain network 
and the task is left to use their explorer when using their chain. 
But what if there is another way? Gladly Tenderly Explorer solves 
the problem with a unified blockchain explorer that provides 
blockchain data in human-readable form. 
In this article, we will dive deep into Tenderly Explorer.

## What is Tenderly Explorer?
Tenderly Explorer is a block explorer that lets you view public data on transactions, 
smart contracts, and addresses on various blockchains supported by Tenderly. 
Transaction hash (transaction ID), tokens, smart contracts 
and wallet addresses can be used to query all related activities 
on Tenderly Explorer.
A registered Tenderly account unlocks Tenderly Explorer to 
a new level with other Tenderly features such as Alerts, Actions etc.

## Features
- History to track recent search
- Support for all the blockchain tenderly support.
- Simulate live pending transactions
- Re-stimulate failed and successful transactions
- Easily Integrate other Tenderly Features such as Debugger, 
Gas Profiler, Alerting, and Actions.

## How to query transactions and wallet addresses on Tenderly Explorer?
One of the features of Tenderly Explorer is tracking transactions. 
For example, imagine you sent 0.001 ether (ETH) from your 
wallet to the following public address:

```
0xeb99efe01daf2e7ef7ac0eec04eabf63151fb9dc.
```

After making the transaction, your wallet display this Transaction ID (TXID):

```
0x088fa395fff12683e595c677063829edcf7214ebfd82821e9b5b840b9a72daba
```

Let’s say you want to check the number of confirmations the transaction has and see if it has been sent successfully.

1. Head to Tenderly Explorer homepage

2. Copy and paste the transaction ID (TXID) into the search field, 
and immediately start searching for it, in this example the transaction ID 
is based on Ethereum Mainnet, once the search is done click on the result.

3. Now you can see all the details regarding your specific transaction: 
Explore the transaction.

let’s go through just the default display:

|Word | Meaning |
|----|----|
|Transaction Hash |	The string of numbers and letters (TXID) associated with your particular transaction.|
|Network |	The Network where the transaction was performed e.g Mainnet, Polygon, Rinkeby, Mumbia|
|Status |	Whether your transaction has failed, is in progress, or was successful.|
|Block |	The block number your transaction was included in.|
|Index |	Integer of the transactions index position in the block|
|Timestamp |	The timestamp of the block your transaction was added to.|
|Nonce |	The number of transactions made by the sender prior to this one.|
|Value |	The amount sent in the transaction.|
|Gas Used |	The amount of Gas used in the transaction|
|Gas Price |	The cost per unit of gas for the transaction.|
|Gas Limit |	The maximum amount of work set estimating a validator will do on a particular transaction|
|Transaction Fee |	The fee paid for making the transaction.|
|Sender |	The wallet address that made the transaction.|
|Receiver |	The receiving address or smart contract.|


## How to look up smart contracts on Tenderly Explorer

Let find out a token address, you can head to CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, 
or the project’s official website. 
You can also check https://etherscan.io/tokens.

Let’s take a look at the MaticToken ERC-20 token on Ethereum:

```
0x7d1afa7b718fb893db30a3abc0cfc608aacfebb0
```

1. Copy and paste the smart contract address into the search field.

2. You’ll now see details on the contract balance and other general information regarding the Matic Token contract.

3. Underneath, In the Transactions panel 
let explore a single transaction. 
In this example we explore transaction ID: 0xf0e0c949b4483b36855f53822fc89a2a47782fc9135451e068ebd2dd6597efcd

## Tenderly Explorer vs EtherScan
While EtherScan is said to be the most sophisticated blockchain explorer 
in Ethereum with a lot of features such as interacting with smart contracts
 e.t.c.
I believe Tenderly Explorer can be used with other blockchains explorer
 due to the extensive features it supports.
